Textures:

all textures must be the same size (i used 16x16 but any size will work).
all textures must be monochrome to be colored properly.


Texture Naming Scheme:

a_ax_ay_bx_by.png


a: possible names separated by a hyphen. look at Blades/hook-sickle_0_0_0_0.png for an example

ax/ay: where the next part attaches to the texture. look at Pommel/pommel1_2_2_0_0.png for an example

bx/by: where the pervious part attaches to the texture. look at Blades/trident_15_15_5_5.png for an example


Materials:

each part folder has a material.txt file which has all the colors for that part
color are in RGB format as a float(0-1 instead of 0-255)
each line is written like R,G,B



if the app crashes/wont open that means you have a texture name or color that does not follow these rules. 
or a file besides a texture or material list is in a parts folder.
